# c-data-structures
Implementation of different types of data structures in the C language as a way to learn about pointers and memory management.
The data structures are not generic as they all encapsulate an integer value.

Data structures:
- Linked List
- Vector
- Stack
- Queue
- Circular Buffer
- Binary Search Tree

Still not implemented:
- Priority Queue
- Set
- Hash Map
- K-ary Tree
- Undirected Graph
- Directed Graph
- ... Graph variants
